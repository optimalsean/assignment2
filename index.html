<h1>On.Lab - Networking for the Public Good</h1>
<p>I chose to spotlight The Open Networking Lab (On.Lab) project and later, ONOS, their open network operating system. They are self-described as, “a non-profit to pursue our vision of what networking could be for the public good.”  
Their mission statement is, “To bring openness and innovation to the Internet and Cloud for the public good.”
Networks today are often closed, proprietary, complex, and inflexible. They seem to be setup to impede innovation and progress rather than enabling them. On.Lab has a vision of what networking could be through the promise of Software Defined Networking (SDN). “With SDN, the control plane is separated from the data plane, the hardware innovation cycles are decoupled from the software innovation cycles. In an SDN-enabled world, Internet and Cloud innovation are able to accelerate innovation while significantly reducing the costs of building and operating networks.” 
Many prominent companies sponsor On.Lab and its many projects including; NEC, Intel, Cisco, NTT Communications, Verizon, Nokia, Ericsson, SK telecom, Fujitsu, Huawei, and AT&T.
AT&T Vice President and Chairman of ONOS Al Blackburn went as far to say, “Open sourcing is a way to foster community engagement and accelerate innovation for SDN. We’re pleased to see carrier-class capabilities like performance, scale and high-availability being addressed in the work at ON.Lab. We’re proud to support the work on ONOS...”
Members can participate in a variety of projects and platforms at a number of different levels.  The most common contributors are corporate level users and developers but many of the projects are available and completely transparent through Github.  Specifically ONOS, their open network operating system.  
According to ONOS project website their governance structure is defined as, “…the ONOS project is a hybrid. It attempts to take what has worked well for open source projects and leave out what didn’t work so well. Mostly, it is governed as a technical meritocracy – those who contribute the most have the most influence. There is also an element of benevolent dictatorship.” 
The Principles of the ONOS project are; to serve our customers, practice true meritocracy, operate with transparency, strive for quality, value and enable innovation, respect others in all Interactions, and above all act in the best interest of the community. 
If you want to get involved you can visit http://onosproject.org/community/ and chose from a number of ways to participate from development to documentation.
On.Lab and ONOS are also on Github, LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook further establishing their online community. </p>
